### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an undergraduate Computer Information Systems Junior at Lone Star Community College & the University of Houston - Victoria. I'm always open to collaborating with others, and working on cool projects. Please reach out to me if you'd like to collaborate, share advice, or to share a restaurant recommendation! 

**About**
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on my coding skills! I'm also dabbling in food photography, UX/UI design, and learning more languages in my free time. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, Javascript, Java, Python, and Data Algorithms. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a twin sister, I'm learning Japanese and Vietnamese, and I like heavy metal.
