### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an undergraduate Computer Science freshman at Lone Star Community College & the University of Houston. I'm always open to collaborating with others, and working on cool projects. Please reach out to me if you'd like to collaborate, share your wise words of widsom, or to share a restaurant recommendation! 

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on my skills to eventually be able to be a great software engineering intern! I'm also dabbling in food photography, UX/UI design, and learning more languages in my free time. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, Javascript, Python, and Data Algorithms. 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything :)
